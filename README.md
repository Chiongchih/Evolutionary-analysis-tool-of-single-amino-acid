# Evolutionary-analysis-tool-of-single-amino-acid
This tool is coded by Changzhi Wang for Dr. Yue Chenâ€™s lab in University of Minnesota, Twin City. And this tool based on database from PhosphositePlus (www.phosphosite.org/), Eggnog (http://eggnogdb.embl.de/#/app/home), WebGestalt (http://www.webgestalt.org/option.php) also including database from Uniprot (http://www.uniprot.org/).

 This tool is designed based on the format of those database, so that potential error might exist without using these data format.
The programming language of this tool is python 3.5. Other python version might cause some unpredictable error.
There are 12 steps in 2 python coded documents. The first document includes step1 and step2, and the second document includes from step 3 to step12. The output of the first document is to be uploaded on eggnog mapper for OG identification, the second document is to further analyze the output from eggnog, and the output of document 2 is the result include the conservation information on each site with p value and percentage.
